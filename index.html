<h2>Ganga River System</h2>
<p>it is one of the largest river systems in the world. 
  The melting water from the Himalayas, as well as water from tributaries and rainfall,
   all feed the sacred river. The Ganges flows south and east from the Himalayas, 
   forming a canyon as it leaves the mountain.</p>

   Tibet (China), Bhutan, India and Bangladesh before entering the Bay of Bengal.

  <h2>Indus River System</h2>
  <p> The Indus River System consists of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas,
     and Satluj, and is made up of the principal tributaries of the Indus River. 
     The Indus water pact was established in 1960 to share water because the Indus
     River passes through both India and Pakistan.</p>
